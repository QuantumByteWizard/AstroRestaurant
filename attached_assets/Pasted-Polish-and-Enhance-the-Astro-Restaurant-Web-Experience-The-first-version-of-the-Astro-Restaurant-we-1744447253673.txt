Polish and Enhance the Astro Restaurant Web Experience

The first version of the Astro Restaurant website is now live and built using GSAP. Now, enhance and refine the experience further to improve fluidity, engagement, and emotional impact through better motion design, interactivity, and layout presentation.

✅ Key Focus Areas for V2:
1. Text Animation Polish
Refine all headline and paragraph animations:

Use GSAP SplitText or similar for character- or word-by-word reveals

Add easing (power4.out, expo.inOut) and staggered timing for smoother entrance

Animate on scroll-in and scroll-out using ScrollTrigger

On mobile: Reduce complexity but maintain elegance

2. Menu Interactivity Upgrade
Add GSAP hover animations for menu items:

Slight scale-up or tilt

Floating ingredient tags on hover (fade-in with delay)

Optional: Ingredient reveal with clipPath or mask animations

Enable category-based transitions with fluid entrance/exit of items (GSAP timeline recommended)

3. Landing Hero Enhancements
Animate the hero background (e.g., floating seafood, waves, or stars) continuously using GSAP timelines

Consider parallax effects linked to scroll or mouse movement

Add scroll-down indicator with looping animation (GSAP loop)

4. Section Transitions
Each section (e.g., Philosophy, Menu, Contact) should animate in with:

Smooth fade/slide transitions

Scroll-based control using ScrollTrigger timelines

Background color/image morph or opacity changes between sections

5. Subtle Microinteractions
Button hover: Add glow or ripple using GSAP

Cursor interaction: Custom cursor or GSAP-based highlight effect

Anchor navigation: Smooth scroll with GSAP instead of default jumps

6. Performance Check
Review animation performance on mobile

Optimize GSAP timelines and avoid janky scroll experiences

Use lazy loading for media-heavy assets

7. Add a Mood Element (Optional but powerful)
Introduce subtle ambient sound (optional toggle) or soft hover sounds

Add ocean sound or underwater bubble FX synced with scroll position

Reminder: The site should now feel smoother, more immersive, and magically alive. Every element — from text to fish — should breathe motion. Keep animations meaningful and not overwhelming.
